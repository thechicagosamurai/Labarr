Privacy Policy for Labarr

Effective Date: July 6, 2025

Introduction

Labarr, developed by SamuraiCode, is a paid application available on the Google Play Store. This Privacy Policy outlines how Labarr handles user data. As an open-source project, Labarr is committed to transparency and user privacy. The app does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

Data Collection

Labarr does not collect, store, or process any personal or sensitive user data, including but not limited to:





Personally identifiable information (e.g., name, email, address).



Device or other identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID, Android ID).



Location data, contacts, camera, microphone, or other sensitive permissions.



Usage data or analytics.

Any data used by Labarr (e.g., local app settings or user-generated content) remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or third parties.

Third-Party Services

Labarr does not integrate third-party services, libraries, or SDKs that collect user data, such as analytics, advertising, or crash reporting tools. If future updates introduce such services, this Privacy Policy will be updated, and users will be notified via the Google Play Store listing.

Permissions

Labarr does not request sensitive permissions (e.g., camera, microphone, location, contacts). If the app requires permissions (e.g., storage for saving files), these are used solely for on-device functionality and do not involve data collection or sharing. You can review the app’s source code to verify permission usage.

Google Play Store

When you purchase Labarr through the Google Play Store, Google may collect data (e.g., payment information, device details) to process the transaction. This data is governed by Google’s Privacy Policy. SamuraiCode does not have access to or control over this data.

Open-Source Code

Labarr is open source under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v3. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/thechicagosamurai/Labarr. You can review the code to confirm that no data collection occurs. The official, signed version of Labarr is available exclusively on the Google Play Store to support the developer.

Data Rights

As Labarr does not collect personal data, there is no user data to access, delete, or modify. If you have questions about your data rights, please contact us.

Children’s Privacy

Labarr is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children, and no additional measures are required under laws like the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in Labarr or legal requirements. The latest version will be posted at this URL, with the effective date updated. Significant changes will be communicated via the Google Play Store listing or within the app.
